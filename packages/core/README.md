## The Core of The Toes

This is our core typescript package for throw-out-error that currently includes a logger and some miscellanous utilities. This was rewritten from our old package, `@throw-out-error/throw-out-utils`.

## WIP

This package is currently work in progress!

## Credits

Special thanks to [trivality](https://github.com/triviality-js/triviality) for the original logger code. Also a ton of credit goes to the authors of nestjs for the dependency injection.
